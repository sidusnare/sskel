WIP
==
This is a massive work in progress. It reflects the way I do things with a UNIX style ./usr/ folder in my home directory. It is an effort to separate the generic and environment specific components of my custom environment. Hopefully you will find something here that can be of use to you, perhaps a new way of managing your $HOME folder. I have tried to make these scripts platform independent, as I myself move across Linux, MacOS, and Solaris.

Reason for the madness
==
The goals here are:
1) Not to have a cluttered $HOME folder
2) Not modify or add to the system path
3) Have things arranged so that having your common custom scripts in a git repository
4) Workstation and platform agnosticism.

The idea is that all your workstations have this same layout, you use a git repo to replicate and sync, and you can just use all the scripts you have written without trying to think what computer you wrote whatever script on and will it work on this one.
